# RGB_Guessing_Game

## About The Project
This game is designed to help you test and improve your knowledge of RGB colour codes. 
<br><br>
The rules consist of finding the right colour by only being told the RGB colour code.
If you guess wrong, the selected tile disappears. However, if you have guessed correctly, all remaining tiles take on the colour you have chosen. 
There are two difficulty level to choose from. 

### Difficulty-Level:
#### EASY
In the ‘EASY’ difficulty mode, you have to find the colour you are looking for from 3 sample colours.

#### HARD
If you select ‘HARD’ as the difficulty level, you have to find the colour you are looking for among six differently coloured tiles. 

### New Color
If you want a new colour or have not found the right colour, you can use ‘NEW COLOR’ to display a new code and new tiles.
